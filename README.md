## Challenge description

<p>
  In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to create a blog from scratch. 
  You will receive a practically blank application that must consume Prismic data and have the interface implemented according to Figma's layout.
  You will have access to several files to implement:
</p>

  -   **Global, common and individual styling;**
  -   **Import of Google fonts;**
  -   **Post pagination;**
  -   **Estimated post reading time calculation;**
  -   **Generation of static pages with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` methods;**
  -   **Formatting dates with `date-fns`;**
  -   **Use of icons with `react-icons`;**
  -   **HTTP requests with `fetch`;**
  -   **Among others.**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
